# Profiles

The plugin is configured via profiles. Each profile is a `.lua` file with a single table containing all user configurable settings. 

To use the plugin, copy the code snippet below and save it in a new file, this file can be named whatever you want, as long as it has a `.lua` suffix.

It is also possible to define a default profile (this should be called `default.lua`) containing the entries that remain the same for all profiles.
You can then define multiple other profiles (e.g. `en.lua`, `jp.lua`, etc.) which contain *only* the fields that differ.
