**crash.log**
`crash.log` is a file that is automatically created when KOReader crashes. It can normally be found in the KOReader directory:

* `/mnt/private/koreader` for Cervantes
* `koreader/` directory for Kindle
* `.adds/koreader/` directory for Kobo
* `applications/koreader/` directory for Pocketbook

Android logs are kept in memory. Please go to [Menu] → Help → Bug Report to save these logs to a file.

Please provide the crash.log even when KOreader did not actually crash! It usually contains the necessary information to ascertain what went wrong.
